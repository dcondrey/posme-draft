--- abstract

This document defines Proof of Sequential Memory Execution (PoSME),
a cryptographic primitive combining mutable arena state, data-
dependent pointer-chase addressing, per-block causal hash binding,
and execution entropy entanglement in a single step function. A
Prover executes K sequential steps over a mutable N-block arena.
Each step reads d blocks at addresses determined by the previous
read's result (pointer chasing), writes one block with symbiotic
binding (new data depends on old causal hash; new causal hash
depends on cursor), and advances a transcript chain. At regular
intervals, CPU jitter entropy is folded into the transcript,
binding the proof to physical execution on a general-purpose
system. The construction provides four properties: (1)
unconditional sequential time enforcement (Omega(K) computation
regardless of storage), (2) forgery prevention via causal hashes
(reduces to collision resistance of H), (3) TMTO resistance
scaling linearly with write density rho = K/N (34x penalty at
rho=16 for a zero-storage adversary), and (4) execution-
environment ASIC resistance (the adversary must execute on a
general-purpose CPU with an operating system to produce valid
entropy, limiting the advantage to commodity hardware variation).
A compact parameter profile achieves these properties with
approximately 32 MiB peak RAM. Verification requires O(Q * d^R *
log N) hash evaluations with no arena allocation. No trusted setup
is required.

# Introduction {#introduction}

Existing primitives for proving sequential computation have
complementary weaknesses. Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs)
{{Boneh2018}} {{Wesolowski2019}} prove sequential time but offer no memory-hardness.
Proofs of Sequential Work (PoSW) {{CohenPietrzak2018}} prove
traversal of a depth-robust graph but operate over static memory.
Memory-hard functions (MHFs) such as Argon2id {{RFC9106}} resist
ASIC acceleration but are single-evaluation primitives with no
chain proof system. Composing these (e.g., chaining Argon2id with
Merkle sampling) produces a construction where sequentiality and
memory-hardness are independent properties; neither reinforces the
other.

PoSME takes a different approach. A persistent mutable arena IS
the computation state. Each step reads via data-dependent pointer
chasing (sequential because each address depends on the previous
read's result) and modifies the arena in-place. A per-block
causal hash chain binds each block's value to the cursor of the
step that wrote it, preventing forgery (the adversary cannot
produce a valid causal hash without knowing the writer's cursor,
which depends on d other blocks' causal hashes, recursively).
The data and causal hash are symbiotically bound: new data
depends on the old causal hash, and the new causal hash depends
on the cursor.

The primary contribution is latency-bound ASIC resistance. Each
pointer-chase iteration is bottlenecked by random DRAM access
(~45ns on DDR5 {{JESD79-5}}), with hash computation (~3ns via
BLAKE3) as a minor component. The ASIC advantage is bounded by
the memory latency ratio (approximately 2x for DDR5 vs HBM3),
tighter than the 8-16x bandwidth bounds of Argon2id
{{Biryukov2016}}. Memory latency improves more slowly than
bandwidth across technology generations (constrained by signal
propagation and DRAM cell sensing time), making this bound more
durable than bandwidth-based resistance.

## Related Work {#related-work}

### Proofs of Sequential Work

PoSW {{CohenPietrzak2018}} proves traversal of a depth-robust
graph via Fiat-Shamir-sampled Merkle proofs. PoSME differs: the
graph is a mutable arena (not a static DAG), the access pattern
is data-dependent (not fixed), and each node carries a causal hash
binding its value to its full write history.

### Memory-Hard Functions

Argon2id {{RFC9106}} resists TMTO via bandwidth-hardness
{{Boneh2016}}, with a single-pass TMTO penalty of approximately 2x. PoSME uses Argon2id
only for arena initialization. The ongoing computation uses
pointer-chasing with in-place writes, creating latency-hardness
(2x ASIC bound vs Argon2id's 8-16x). PoSME's TMTO penalty is
approximately 2+2\*rho for zero-storage adversaries, where
rho = K/N is the write density (10x at rho=4 vs Argon2id's 2x).

### Proofs of Space-Time

Proofs of Space-Time (PoST) {{Chia2024}} {{Spacemesh2023}} enforce both
sequential time and persistent storage by requiring a Prover to
repeatedly prove possession of stored data over a sequence of
time intervals. PoST operates over a static graph: the stored
data does not change between proofs, and the graph structure is
fixed before execution. PoSME differs in that the arena is
mutable (each step modifies it), the access pattern is data-
dependent (addresses are determined by arena contents, not
pre-computed), and each block carries a causal hash binding its
current value to its write history. These differences make PoSME
a different construction with different TMTO characteristics,
not a strict improvement over PoST.

### Cumulative Memory Complexity

Alwen, Blocki, and Pietrzak {{AlwenBlockPietrzak2017}} formalized
cumulative memory complexity for static graph pebbling games.
PoSME's causal dependency DAG is dynamic (edges are created during
execution), requiring a new pebbling framework. The dynamic
pebbling analysis is provided in {{tmto}}.

# Construction {#construction}

## Arena Block Format {#block-format}

Each arena block is a pair:

~~~ pseudocode
block = {
    data:   bytes[32],
    causal: bytes[32]
}
~~~

The `data` field stores the block's computational value. The
`causal` field stores the causal hash chain: a running digest
binding the block's current value to the cursor of the step
that last wrote it.

## Arena Initialization {#init}

The arena is initialized deterministically from a public seed s:

~~~ pseudocode
for i in 0..N-1:
    if i == 0:
        A[0].data = H("PoSME-init-v1" || s || I2OSP(0, 4))
    else:
        A[i].data = H("PoSME-init-v1" || s || I2OSP(i, 4)
                      || A[i-1].data
                      || A[floor(i/2)].data)
    A[i].causal = H("PoSME-causal-v1" || s || I2OSP(i, 4))

root_0 = MerkleRoot(A)
T_0 = H("PoSME-transcript-v1" || s || root_0)
~~~

The initialization references both the preceding block (A\[i-1\])
and a logarithmic skip-link (A\[floor(i/2)\]). This creates a
dependency DAG of depth log(N) and width N, requiring
Omega(sqrt(N)) space to evaluate (the DAG cannot be streamed
in constant space because each block depends on a block
approximately N/2 positions behind it). A custom initialization
is used rather than Argon2id because Argon2id's fixed internal
graph does not provide this skip-link structure; the logarithmic
back-references are necessary for the space-hardness property.

The Verifier can independently compute root\_0 and T\_0 from the
seed, providing a trusted anchor for all subsequent verification.

## Step Function {#step-function}

At each step t in {1, ..., K}:

~~~ pseudocode
STEP(t):
    // 1. Pointer-chase reads (data-dependent)
    cursor = T_{t-1}
    addrs = []
    for j in 0..d-1:
        a = OS2IP(XOF(cursor, j)) mod N
        addrs.append(a)
        val = A[a]
        cursor = H(cursor || val.data || val.causal)

    // 2. Write with symbiotic binding
    w = OS2IP(XOF(cursor, d)) mod N
    old = A[w]
    new_data = H(old.data || cursor || old.causal)
    new_causal = H(old.causal || cursor || I2OSP(t, 4))
    A[w] = {data: new_data, causal: new_causal}

    // 3. Update commitments
    root_t = MerkleUpdate(root_{t-1}, w, A[w])
    T_t = H(T_{t-1} || I2OSP(t, 4) || cursor || root_t)

    // 4. Log step
    log[t] = {addrs, reads, w, old, A[w], cursor, root_t}
~~~

### Pointer-Chase Addressing {#address-gen}

Read addresses are data-dependent: address j+1 depends on the
value and causal hash of the block read at address j. This creates
a pointer-chasing chain within each step that is inherently
sequential.

### Symbiotic Binding {#symbiotic-binding}

The data update incorporates the old causal hash:

~~~ pseudocode
new_data = H(old_data || cursor || old_causal)
~~~

This creates bidirectional dependency: data depends on causal
history, and causal hash depends on cursor (which depends on
data). Neither can be independently fabricated. An adversary
forging data must know old\_causal; forging causal must know the
cursor; computing the cursor requires reading d blocks with
their causal hashes.

### Transcript Chain {#transcript-chain}

The transcript chain T\_t binds all steps causally:

~~~ pseudocode
T_t = H(T_{t-1} || I2OSP(t, 4) || cursor || root_t)
~~~

T\_t incorporates root\_t (the Merkle root after the write) and
cursor (which depends on the arena state at step t). Computing
T\_t requires computing all prior steps.

### Jitter Entanglement {#jitter-entanglement}

At regular intervals during execution, the Prover samples CPU
jitter entropy and folds it into the transcript chain. This binds
the proof to physical execution on a general-purpose system with
an operating system.

~~~ pseudocode
ENTANGLE(T_t, m, K):
    interval = K / m
    jitter_samples = []

    // At steps t where t mod interval == 0:
    j = sample_cpu_jitter()
    jitter_samples.append((t, j))
    T_t = H("PoSME-entangle-v1" || T_t || j)
~~~

The jitter source MUST be CPU execution timing variance (e.g.,
rdtsc delta across a calibration loop), not a pseudorandom
generator. CPU jitter arises from instruction pipeline stalls,
cache miss variability, branch misprediction recovery, OS
scheduler preemption, and memory controller contention. These are
emergent properties of general-purpose CPU execution under an
operating system that cannot be replicated by fixed-function
hardware.

The Prover MUST include at least m = 16 jitter samples in the
proof. The number of samples and the injection interval are
included in the proof and verified.

The Verifier checks:

1. Each jitter sample is incorporated into the transcript at the
   claimed step via the entanglement hash.
2. The jitter samples exhibit sufficient min-entropy (at least 1
   bit per sample, measured via the NIST SP 800-90B most common
   value estimator).
3. The final transcript T\_K depends on all jitter samples.

An adversary using fixed-function hardware (ASIC/FPGA) cannot
produce genuine CPU jitter. Injecting pseudorandom values fails
the min-entropy test when the Verifier cross-checks against the
expected statistical properties of OS scheduling jitter
(quantized intervals, interrupt clustering, sub-microsecond
variance). The adversary's only option is to execute on a
general-purpose CPU with an OS, limiting the hardware advantage
to commodity CPU-to-CPU performance variation (approximately 2x).

## Root Chain Commitment {#root-chain}

The Prover commits to the sequence of ALL K arena roots:

~~~ pseudocode
R = [root_0, root_1, ..., root_K]
C_roots = MerkleRoot(R)
~~~

This root chain commitment binds the Prover to a specific
sequence of arena states BEFORE Fiat-Shamir challenges are
derived. The challenges depend on (T\_K, C\_roots), and both
must be fixed before the Prover knows which steps will be
challenged.

## Proof Generation {#proof-gen}

~~~ pseudocode
PROVE(K, Q, R_depth):
    C_roots = MerkleRoot([root_0, ..., root_K])
    challenges = FS(T_K, C_roots, Q)
    proof = {params, T_K, C_roots, step_proofs: []}

    for c in challenges:
        sp = make_step_proof(c, R_depth)
        proof.step_proofs.append(sp)
    return proof

make_step_proof(step, depth):
    sp = {
        step_id: step,
        cursor_in: T_{step-1},
        cursor_out: log[step].cursor,
        root_before: root_{step-1},
        root_after: log[step].root_t,
        root_chain_paths: [
            MerklePath(C_roots, step-1),

        ],
        reads: [],
        write: {addr, old, new,
                merkle_path: MerklePath(root_{step-1}, w)},
        writers: []
    }
    for j in 0..d-1:
        sp.reads.append({
            addr, block, merkle_path:
                MerklePath(root_{step-1}, addr)})
        if depth > 0:
            ws = last_writer(addr, step)
            if ws == 0:
                sp.writers.append({type: "init",
                    init_path: MerklePath(root_0, addr)})
            else:
                sp.writers.append({type: "step",
                    proof: make_step_proof(ws, depth-1)})
        else:

## Verification Cost {#verify-cost}

For Q challenges with recursion depth R:

- Root chain proofs: O(Q * log K) per challenged step
- Arena Merkle proofs: O(Q * d^R * log N)
- Cursor replays: O(Q * d^R * d)
- No arena memory allocation

For Q=128, d=8, R=3, N=2^24, K=4\*N=2^26:

| Operation | Count |
|---|---|
| Root chain verifications | 128 * 2 * 26 = ~6.7K hashes |
| Arena Merkle verifications | 128 * 512 * 24 = ~1.6M hashes |
| Cursor replays | 128 * 512 * 8 = ~524K hashes |
| Total | ~2.1M hashes, ~6ms |

The ~6ms estimate assumes a modern desktop CPU (~350M BLAKE3
hashes/second). On constrained platforms (mobile: 60-300ms;
WASM: 120ms-600ms), verification is slower but still practical.
No memory allocation beyond the proof data is required.

# Security Analysis {#security}

## Threat Model {#threat-model}

The adversary is a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm with
random oracle access to H. The adversary receives the public
seed s and parameters (N, K, d, Q, R). Its goal is to produce
(T\_K, C\_roots, proof) that passes VERIFY ({{verify-procedure}})
while either:

1. **Forgery:** producing T\_K' != T\_K (the honestly computed
   transcript), or
2. **Space reduction:** using less than N \* B bits of arena
   storage at some point during computation.

The adversary may use custom hardware with faster memory (lower
latency) than the honest Prover. The ASIC resistance analysis
({{asic-resistance}}) bounds the resulting speedup.

## Forgery Prevention {#soundness}

The causal hash mechanism prevents block value fabrication.
To forge a block's causal hash, the adversary needs the cursor
of the step that wrote it. That cursor depends on d blocks read
at the writer step, each with their own causal hashes requiring
their own writers' cursors, recursively. Symbiotic binding
strengthens this: forging data requires old\_causal, and forging
old\_causal requires the prior writer's cursor. Neither field
can be independently fabricated.

The root chain commitment ({{root-chain}}) binds the Prover to
ALL K arena roots before challenges are derived. C\_roots is an
input to the Fiat-Shamir challenge derivation, so the Prover
cannot fabricate roots after seeing challenges.

**Theorem 1 (Soundness).** Any adversary producing
(T\_K', C\_roots', proof') with T\_K' != T\_K that passes VERIFY
has advantage at most K \* epsilon\_cr, where epsilon\_cr is the
collision-finding advantage against H.

**Proof sketch.** If verification passes with T\_K' != T\_K, there
exists a step c where T\_{c-1}' = T\_{c-1} but T\_c' != T\_c (the
first divergence). At step c, the Verifier checks that T\_c =
H(T\_{c-1} \|\| c \|\| cursor \|\| root\_c). If the adversary's
inputs differ from the honest inputs but produce the same T\_c,
this is a collision in H. If the adversary's inputs differ and
produce a different T\_c, then T\_c' != T\_c, contradicting
acceptance. The adversary has K steps at which to attempt this,
giving the union bound K \* epsilon\_cr.

A full derivation is provided in the companion
analysis (to appear as IACR ePrint).

## Recomputation Cost {#recomp-cost}

Separately from forgery prevention, causal hashes impose a
constant-factor increase on the cost of recomputing missing
blocks. Without causal hashes, an adversary recomputing a
missing block traverses its write chain at cost O(rho) hashes
(one per write in the chain). With causal hashes, the adversary
must traverse both the data chain and the causal chain, doubling
the cost to O(2\*rho) per miss.

This is a MODERATE improvement: a 2x constant factor on write
chain traversal, not an exponential blowup. The TMTO penalty
table in {{tmto}} incorporates this factor. The causal hash
mechanism's primary contribution is soundness ({{soundness}}),
not TMTO amplification.

## TMTO Lower Bound {#tmto}

An adversary storing alpha \* N blocks faces a two-layer penalty:

### Sequential Floor {#sequential-floor}

The transcript chain T\_0 through T\_K must be computed
sequentially to produce T\_K before Fiat-Shamir challenges are
derived. This is an Omega(K) lower bound regardless of storage.

### Write Density and Arena Coverage {#write-density}

Each step writes 1 block at a uniformly random address (in the
ROM). After K steps, the fraction of blocks written at least once
is phi = 1 - e^{-rho}, where rho = K/N is the write density.

A block that was never written retains its initialization value,
recomputable in O(1) from the seed. Only written blocks require
write chain traversal for recomputation. The expected write chain
length for a modified block is rho, costing O(rho) hashes.

| rho = K/N | Blocks modified | Recomp cost/miss | alpha=0 TMTO ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.25 | 22% | O(1) | 2.5x |
| 1 | 63% | O(1) | 4x |
| 4 | 98% | O(4) | 10x |
| 16 | ~100% | O(16) | 34x |

K MUST be at least N (rho >= 1) for meaningful TMTO resistance.
Values of rho >= 4 are RECOMMENDED.

### Per-Step Recomputation Cost

**Theorem 2 (TMTO).** In the random oracle model, any adversary
storing alpha \* N arena blocks and all K cursors (K \* 32 bytes)
performs expected computation at least:

~~~ artwork
T_adv >= K * d * (1 + (1-alpha) * (2*rho + 1))
~~~

giving a TMTO ratio of T\_adv / T\_honest >= 1 + (1-alpha) \* (2\*rho + 1).

**Proof sketch.** The adversary computes the K-step transcript
chain (Theorem 1 of the companion analysis: Omega(K) sequential
floor). At each step, d blocks are read at addresses uniform in
\[N\] (random oracle property). Each read misses the stored set
with probability 1-alpha. Each miss requires traversing the
block's write chain (expected length rho) for both data and
causal hash, costing 2\*rho + 1 hashes. The per-step cost is
d \* (1 + (1-alpha) \* (2\*rho + 1)). Summing over K steps gives
the bound.

This bound assumes optimal cursor storage (adversary stores all
K cursors). A full derivation and optimality analysis for
alternative cursor strategies is provided in the companion
analysis (to appear as IACR ePrint).

| rho = K/N | alpha=0 penalty | alpha=0.5 penalty |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 4x | 2.5x |
| 4 | 10x | 5.5x |
| 16 | 34x | 17.5x |

The penalty scales linearly with rho.

This bound assumes the adversary stores all K cursors
(K \* 32 bytes; 512 MiB for K = 2^26). Storing all cursors is
optimal for the adversary: it eliminates the need for sequential
replay from checkpoints. An adversary who stores cursors at
intervals of L steps instead pays an additional L \* d \*
(1 + (1-alpha) \* (2\*rho + 1)) hashes per cursor miss. Sparse
cursor storage strictly increases the adversary's cost; the
bound above is a LOWER bound on the TMTO penalty.

### Dynamic Pebbling Game {#pebbling-game}

PoSME's causal DAG is dynamic: edges are created during
execution based on data-dependent addressing. In the random
oracle model, each step creates d edges to uniformly random
targets. The pebbling game:

1. N block nodes (arena) and K step nodes.
2. At step t, the game reveals d random read addresses.
3. To execute step t, the adversary must have pebbles on all
   d read addresses (stored or recomputed at cost O(rho)).
4. The adversary maintains auxiliary state (cursors, write
   index) of at most K \* 32 bytes.

Any adversary storing alpha \* N blocks and all K cursors
performs expected computation:

~~~ artwork
T_adv >= K * d * (1 + (1-alpha) * (2*rho + 1))
~~~

The honest cost is K \* d. The TMTO ratio is
1 + (1-alpha) \* (2\*rho + 1). For alpha=0, rho=4:
the adversary pays 10x honest cost. The penalty is LINEAR
in rho, not exponential.

## ASIC Resistance {#asic-resistance}

PoSME is designed to be latency-dominated: hash computation
constitutes less than 10% of per-step cost, making the
bottleneck memory random-access latency rather than computation
throughput. This is a structural property of the construction
(it holds for any instantiation where H is significantly faster
than a DRAM random read).

The specific advantage ratio depends on the memory technology
available to the adversary. Current measurements:

| Component | Consumer DDR5 | ASIC (HBM3) | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| Memory read | ~45ns | ~20ns | 2.25x |
| BLAKE3 hash | ~3ns | ~0.3ns | 10x |
| **Total** | **~48ns** | **~20.3ns** | **~2.4x** |

These are empirical values for 2024-era memory technology, not
formal bounds. The approximately 2x ratio reflects the current
DDR5-to-HBM3 latency gap {{JESD79-5}} {{JESD238}}. With aggressive
controller optimization: up to 3x.

An adversary with on-die SRAM (~1-5ns access) could cache a
fraction of hot blocks. However, with 1 GiB arena and typical
ASIC SRAM budgets (8-32 MiB), the SRAM hit rate for uniform
random addresses is 0.8-3.1%, providing negligible benefit.
Larger SRAM allocations are economically prohibitive (1 GiB of
on-die SRAM costs orders of magnitude more than 1 GiB of DRAM).

For comparison, bandwidth-hard constructions (Argon2id) have
empirical ASIC advantage of 8-16x {{Biryukov2016}}
{{RenDevadas2017}}. The structural argument for PoSME's
durability: memory latency is constrained by DRAM cell sensing
time and signal propagation, which improve more slowly than
bandwidth (wider buses, more channels) across technology
generations.

## Sequentiality {#sequentiality}

Intra-step: The d reads form a pointer-chasing chain; read j+1's
address depends on read j's result.

Inter-step: T\_t feeds into address generation for step t+1.

Together: K \* d sequential memory accesses, each bottlenecked
by DRAM latency.

# Parameters {#parameters}

## Proof Size Optimization {#proof-size-opt}

The recursion depth R and challenge count Q present a direct tradeoff
between security margin and proof size. Table 6 provides concrete MiB-
per-proof costs for implementers.

| Recursion (R) | Challenges (Q) | Blocks (B) | Size (MiB) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 64 | 81 | 3.9 |
| 2 | 128 | 81 | 7.9 |
| **3** | **64** | **657** | **32.1** |
| 3 | 128 | 657 | 64.2 |

While R=3 yields significantly larger proofs, it provides
exponentially higher fabrication resistance by checking the witnesses
of the writers' writers. For bandwidth-constrained environments (e.g.,
light clients), R=2 with Q=128 offers a compact ~8 MiB proof while
maintaining high confidence.

## Recommended Parameters {#recommended-params}

PoSME's security properties have different parameter dependencies.
TMTO resistance ({{tmto}}) depends on the write density rho = K/N
and is independent of arena size. ASIC resistance can be achieved
through two complementary mechanisms: (a) arena size exceeding the
adversary's fastest memory ({{asic-resistance}}), or (b) mandatory
jitter entanglement requiring a general-purpose CPU with an OS
({{jitter-entanglement}}). Applications SHOULD select parameters
based on their threat model.

### Design Trade-off: N vs rho {#n-vs-rho}

Arena size N and write density rho = K/N are independent knobs
controlling different security properties:

- N controls latency-bound ASIC resistance: the arena must exceed
  the adversary's fastest accessible memory (L3 cache, SRAM).
  Larger N requires more Prover RAM.
- rho controls TMTO resistance: penalty = 1 + (1-alpha)(2\*rho+1)
  for an adversary storing alpha\*N blocks. Higher rho requires
  more steps (longer wall time) but no additional RAM.

For applications where ASIC resistance is provided by jitter
entanglement ({{jitter-entanglement}}) rather than arena size,
N can be reduced while rho is increased. This yields strictly
superior TMTO resistance with dramatically lower RAM. The
Compact profile exploits this trade-off.

### Parameter Profiles {#param-profiles}

Four profiles are defined. All profiles share fixed parameters:
block size B = 64 bytes, reads per step d = 8, hash function H =
BLAKE3. Jitter entanglement ({{jitter-entanglement}}) is REQUIRED
for the Compact profile and RECOMMENDED for all profiles.

| Profile | N | Arena | rho | K | Q | R | Peak RAM | TMTO | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Compact | 2^18 | 16 MiB | 16 | 16\*N | 64 | 2 | ~32 MiB | 34x | Attestation, mobile, resource-constrained |
| Standard | 2^20 | 64 MiB | 4 | 4\*N | 64 | 2 | ~128 MiB | 10x | General attestation, Sybil resistance |
| Enhanced | 2^22 | 256 MiB | 4 | 4\*N | 128 | 3 | ~512 MiB | 10x | High-assurance with latency-bound ASIC resistance |
| Maximum | 2^24 | 1 GiB | 4 | 4\*N | 128 | 3 | ~2 GiB | 10x | Consensus, mining, custom hardware adversaries |

The Compact profile uses a small, cache-resident arena with high
write density. Because the arena fits in L3 cache, per-step
latency is lower (~300 ns vs ~2750 ns), but TMTO resistance is
3.4x stronger than the Maximum profile (34x vs 10x). ASIC
resistance is provided by mandatory jitter entanglement rather
than arena size: any adversary must execute on a general-purpose
CPU with an OS to produce valid entropy samples, limiting the
hardware advantage to commodity CPU-to-CPU variation (~2x).

The Compact profile's rho MAY be increased beyond 16 for stronger
TMTO at the cost of additional wall time:

| rho | TMTO (alpha=0) | K (N=2^18) | Wall time (~300 ns/step) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 34x | 4.2M | ~1.3 seconds |
| 64 | 130x | 16.8M | ~5 seconds |
| 256 | 514x | 67M | ~20 seconds |

The Standard and Enhanced profiles exceed consumer L3 caches
(16-36 MiB as of 2024) and provide latency-bound ASIC resistance
via arena size. The Maximum profile (1 GiB) exceeds all current
L3 caches and limits GPU throughput via the capacity-bandwidth
bound.

### Memory Budget {#memory-budget}

The Prover's peak memory comprises three components:

| Component | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Arena | N \* 64 bytes | Required for computation |
| Merkle tree | 2 \* N \* 32 bytes | Required for root updates |
| Root chain | (K + 1) \* 32 bytes | Sequential; MAY be streamed to disk |

The root chain is written sequentially during pass 1 and read
sequentially during pass 2. Implementations MAY stream the root
chain to persistent storage to reduce peak RAM by K \* 32 bytes,
at the cost of additional I/O.

Peak RAM by profile (with root chain streaming):

| Profile | Arena + Merkle | Root chain (disk) | Peak RAM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compact | 32 MiB | 128 MiB | ~32 MiB |
| Standard | 128 MiB | 128 MiB | ~128 MiB |
| Enhanced | 512 MiB | 512 MiB | ~512 MiB |
| Maximum | 2 GiB | 2 GiB | ~2 GiB |

## Parameter Validation {#param-validation}

Verifiers MUST reject proofs with parameters below these minimums:

| Parameter | Minimum | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| N | 2^18 | Below this, arena is too small for meaningful pointer-chase depth |
| K | N | Below N, most blocks are never written; TMTO is trivial |
| K/N (rho) | 4 | Below this, TMTO penalty < 10x |
| d | 4 | Below this, causal fan-out is insufficient |
| Q | 64 | Below this, detection probability < 2^{-64} |
| R | 2 | Below this, causal verification is shallow |

When N < 2^20 (arena fits in consumer L3 cache), jitter
entanglement ({{jitter-entanglement}}) is REQUIRED. The Verifier
MUST reject proofs with N < 2^20 that do not include valid jitter
samples.

## Performance Estimates {#performance}

The following properties are machine-independent:

| Property | Compact | Standard | Maximum |
|---|---|---|---|
| TMTO penalty (alpha=0) | 34x | 10x | 10x |
| ASIC resistance mechanism | Jitter | Arena + Jitter | Arena |
| Proof size | ~3.9 MiB | ~3.9 MiB | ~64 MiB |

Reference timings (Apple M-series, DDR5; will vary by hardware):

| Profile | Per-step | Wall time | Prover peak RAM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compact (16 MiB, rho=16) | ~300 ns | ~1.3 seconds | ~32 MiB |
| Compact (16 MiB, rho=256) | ~300 ns | ~20 seconds | ~32 MiB |
| Standard (64 MiB) | ~1500 ns | ~6 seconds | ~128 MiB |
| Enhanced (256 MiB) | ~2200 ns | ~37 seconds | ~512 MiB |
| Maximum (1 GiB) | ~2750 ns | ~185 seconds | ~2 GiB (disk) |

Verifier time is independent of profile (depends on Q, d, R, N):

| Metric | Compact/Standard | Enhanced/Maximum |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop | ~2 ms | ~6 ms |
| Mobile | 20-100 ms | 60-300 ms |

A reference benchmark with pre-compiled binaries is provided
as ancillary material (anc/README.md).

# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

## Work vs. Time {#work-vs-time}

PoSME proves sequential memory execution, not elapsed time. An
adversary with faster memory (lower latency) completes the same
computation in less wall-clock time. The ASIC advantage is bounded
(approximately 2x) but nonzero. Applications requiring temporal
guarantees MUST combine PoSME with an external time-binding
mechanism such as hardware-attested timestamps.

Hardware-independent time-binding is fundamentally impossible:
deterministic computation produces identical output regardless of
hardware speed, and self-reported timing is forgeable.

## Seed Requirements {#seed-requirements}

The seed MUST be externally fixed or derived from an unpredictable
source. A Prover-controlled seed enables grinding for favorable
arena initializations with reduced effective working sets.

## Verification Complexity {#verify-complexity}

We conjecture that O(1) verification under hash-only assumptions
is not achievable for sequential pointer-chasing computations
of the type PoSME specifies. The verification complexity in this
document is O(Q \* d^R \* log N). O(log^2 K) verification is
believed achievable via FRI/STARK-based commitment (requiring
field arithmetic but no trusted setup) and is left as a future
optimization. A formal impossibility proof for constant-size
hash-only verification of PoSME remains open.

## Verifier Resource Limits {#verifier-limits}

Verifiers SHOULD implement rate limiting and MUST reject proofs
with parameters exceeding configured thresholds before allocating
resources for verification.

## Open Problems {#open-problems}

The dynamic pebbling game ({{pebbling-game}}) provides a framework
for TMTO analysis, but a machine-checked proof of the space-time
lower bound remains open. The adversary's optimal caching strategy
(which blocks to store, when to checkpoint) has not been formally
optimized. Block access distribution uniformity under hash-derived
addressing requires formal characterization; skewed distributions
may enable hot-block caching. The tight relationship between
committed step frequency C, write density rho, and the optimal
adversary strategy requires further analysis.
